In these folders it is possible to find the assignments handed out during the Machine Learning course from the first semester of the first year of my Master Degree.

Assignments are divided by topic: they contain instructions and in some cases they are partly guided. However, the theoretical answers and the core portions of the code were to be filled out by each student step by step.

As usual, both .ipynb and .html formats are available to facilitate consultation.
