# MasterDegree Projects

This is a collection of the most relevant projects and assignments that I had to carry out throughout my Master Degree in Physics of Data at the University of Padua. Most of these projects were completed either in pairs or in small groups (typically 3 people).

Each folder represents a different course I followed and, if necessary, a further division into topics is present. When available, I always included also the requirements for each project, which serve as a summary of the topics, the algorithms and the analysis techniques implemented for that given project. 

For the coding files, both .ipynb and .html formats are usually available to facilitate consultation; please take notice that I did not upload the datasets, so running the Jupyter Notebooks as they are will result in an error. Often a written report is also present, which represents the final result of the work done.
